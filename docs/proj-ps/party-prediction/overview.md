# Overview

Party prediction is a foundation for understanding political interactions - one can't study differences and conflicts between groups without knowing the groups. We began this research with a thorough comparison of existing and novel approaches. We are currently studying new methods to leverage text, and to make predictions in complex multiparty environments.
