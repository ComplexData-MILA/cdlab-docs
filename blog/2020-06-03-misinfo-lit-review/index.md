# Literature Review on Misinformation

This is a series of posts conducting a literature review on misinformation, especially
in relation to technology and social media. The intention is to organize
my thoughts and to provide the reader with condensed information beyond
what can be found in the abstract.

For each paper I give the setting, main contributions, data used, and
some strengths and limitations. These opinions are my own and are
presented to give the reader some ideas. They do not represent an
ironclad critical review; your judgment may vary, and so might mine on
subsequent readings.
